# Python Learning Journey

## Overview
This serves to document my progress as I learn Python.
I intend to tackle the Codecademy Python3 course, Leetcode problems, Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
This repo will house any projects from the course, Leetcode solutions and any practice algorithms that are relatively small in scope. 

## Repository Structure
- `algorithms/`: Contains solutions to coding challenges and algorithmic problems
  - `leetcode/`: Solutions to LeetCode problems organized by difficulty
  - `other_challenges/`: Solutions from other coding platforms
- `mini_projects/`: Self-contained Python projects, typically from Codecademy
- `practice_scripts/`: Single-file scripts exploring various Python concepts

## Navigation
Each directory contains its own README with specific details about the contents and learning objectives.
