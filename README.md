# Python Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my journey learning Python, including algorithm solutions, mini-projects, and practice scripts. It serves as both a learning log and a portfolio of my progress.

## Repository Structure
- `algorithms/`: Contains solutions to coding challenges and algorithmic problems
  - `leetcode/`: Solutions to LeetCode problems organized by difficulty
  - `other_challenges/`: Solutions from other coding platforms
- `mini_projects/`: Self-contained Python projects
- `practice_scripts/`: Single-file scripts exploring various Python concepts

## Navigation
Each directory contains its own README with specific details about the contents and learning objectives.

## Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd python-learning-journey

# Optional: Set up a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
